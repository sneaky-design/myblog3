            Billiards: cue sports in general, including pool, carom billiards, snooker, English billiard etc.; the term "billiards" by itself is also sometimes used to refer to any of the following more specifically:
            Carom billiards (also known as French billiards), games in general (a chiefly non-British usage)
            Three-cushion billiards even more specifically, the most popular form of carom billiards worldwide (the most common specific usage)
            The specific game of English billiards (a chiefly British, Irish and Australian usage)
            Pool (cue sports) (pocket billiards) games, such as eight-ball and nine-ball, in general (a chiefly colloquial North American usage)
            See the list of cue sports for various other games with "billiards" in their names; also more specifically:
            Pin billiards (disambiguation)
            Bar billiards, a game combining elements of bagatelle and English billiards
            Electric billiards, an obsolete term for pinball (from billard Ã©lectrique in French, in which pinball is today called flipper, a borrowing from English) </p>

        <p>my hobby is popular since it is played around the world. it has a variety of ways to play it and alot of games on it.out of all of the modes my favourite has to be nine ball since it has a specific pattern to hit the balls in instead of hitting them randomly then hitting the black ball.</p>
